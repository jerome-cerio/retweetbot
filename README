This program enables one's own Twitter account,
or a twitter bot, to retweet tweets from specific accounts.

In particular, this program enables my account to retweet all tweets from the accounts
@RiceUniversity and @RiceEngineering that pertain to the keywords
"engineering" and "computer science"

To use this program in a similar way, one would need to register a
Twitter account as a developer account, set up a project and app, and
then generate the necessary authentication tokens:
Client/API Key and Key Secret, Access Key and Key Secret, and Bearer Token.
